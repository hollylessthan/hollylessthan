###  👋 Hello, I'm Holly. 
### I’m a data & AI engineer focusing on building production-grade analytics and agentic AI systems — systems that move beyond demos and actually support real decision-making.
My work sits at the intersection of data engineering, analytics, and GenAI. I’m especially interested in how LLMs can reason over structured data, metadata, and business context to create trustworthy, end-to-end analytical workflows.

 🌱 __Current Project Focus__

My recent work centers on:

- **Agentic analytics systems**  
  Multi-agent workflows for SQL generation, data profiling, preprocessing decisions, analysis, visualization, and narrative synthesis.

- **GenAI for structured data**  
  RAG over schemas, metrics, and metadata; constrained LLM reasoning on numerical datasets.

- **AI-ready data infrastructure**  
  Analytics layers optimized for LLM consumption (wide tables, semantic context, embeddings, materialized views).

- **Metadata & documentation automation**  
  LLM-driven generation and validation of analytical documentation and method cards.

- **Applied data engineering**  
  Scalable pipelines, analytical modeling, and performance-oriented system design.

🛠 __Stack (varies by project)__

- **Data:** SQL, DuckDB, Pandas, Spark, Iceberg  
- **AI / Agents:** LLMs, RAG, LangChain, LangGraph, vector search  
- **Infra:** Python, AWS (serverless, event-driven), CDK  
- **Apps:** Streamlit, analytical UIs

## 🎓 __Background__

- MS, Business Analytics — UC San Diego  
- BS, Quantitative Finance — National Tsing Hua University  

I work as a data engineer building production analytics and GenAI systems, and this experience informs the architectural decisions explored in these projects.
